C# MySQL License System V2


v1
I made a simple licensing system on my own scale. I used MySQL and C # to show you how you can generate a license key and compare it with the database. You can further develop it if you want.

v2
In this project, we added key generation with 5 to 4 variable, as an extra, we added the license expiry date.
